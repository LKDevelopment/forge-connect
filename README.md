This is an CLI Tool to easily connect to your Servers from [Forge](https://forge.laravel.com). Actually it is Mac Only!
## Installation

```bash
composer global require lkdev/forge-connect
```

Than simply run to register your Forge Credentials. There will be encrypted and saved. You must define your own Passphrase
```bash
forge-connect register [YourForgeEMail] [YourForgePassword]
```
And now you can list all your Servers with:
```bash
forge-connect servers:list
```

And if you want to connect per SSH to one of your servers:
```bash
forge-connect connect [NameOfYourServerFromForge]
```
